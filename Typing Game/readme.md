# Typing Challenge Game

This is a simple typing challenge game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to type the displayed phrase as quickly and accurately as possible. After typing, your speed and accuracy are measured and displayed.

## Features

- Randomly selects a phrase for the user to type.
- Measures the time taken to type the phrase.
- Compares the user input with the displayed phrase to calculate the score.
- Displays time taken and accuracy after each round.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the game interface.
- `app.js`: Contains the logic for selecting random words, timing, and calculating the score.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Game**: Press the "Start" button to begin the typing challenge. A random phrase will be displayed, and the typing area will be enabled.
2. **Type the Phrase**: Type the phrase shown on the screen as quickly and accurately as you can.
3. **End the Game**: After typing the phrase, click "Done" to stop the timer. The game will calculate the time taken and the number of correct words.
4. **Results**: The total time and score will be displayed. The score is based on how many words you typed correctly compared to the original phrase.



## Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels (e.g., longer or more complex phrases).
- Implement a high score tracker.
- Improve the user interface with more styling and animations.
- Include a countdown timer before starting the game.
- Provide real-time feedback on typing accuracy.
